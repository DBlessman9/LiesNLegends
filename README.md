# Lies&Legends

A concentration/deception game  for adults who want to use deductive reasoning to figure out which player is the imposter.

## Story
As a student at the Apple Developer Academy, Detroit; one of our challenges was to design a game. 

Lies & Legends is a fast-paced social deduction party game where players test their ability to bluff, deduce, and drop cultural knowledge. In each round, one player secretly takes on the role of the Imposter, while the rest are Legitimates who know the correct cultural reference. Players take turns giving clues related to their assigned words, trying to stay in character, blend in, or deduce who the Imposter is. The game creates a fun mix of
strategy, observation, and deception.

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

Lies & Legends gave us the chance to utilize AVFoundation in the implementation of audio resources such as game music and sound effects.

The application of @State was crucial to the implementation of labeling and removing of the "imposter", as well as determing player card positions, giving the game a dynamic look and feel.

The List struct was utilized to display an array of players which can be modified by the user(s).
